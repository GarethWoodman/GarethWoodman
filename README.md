# Side Projects

This repository highlights a few of my personal projects that show my full-stack skills and self-driven approach. The code itself is private to protect intellectual property, but I’m always happy to share live demos and walk through how it all works! Most of my day-to-day commits are split across private repositories and both work and personal GitHub accounts, so my public contribution graph doesn’t fully reflect my activity.

**Live Demo:** [https://www.dentie..co.uk](https://www.dentie.co.uk)

A lightweight starter SaaS application built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, DynamoDB, Cognito and Tailwind CSS. The idea was inspired by my partner, who is a dentist, and her day-to-day workflows. Building it gave me the opportunity to explore how to structure a web app with authentication, database integration, and simple UI components. Users can create templates with single, multi-select and custom fields to standardize input for notes or records.

**Key Features:**
- Basic template creation with single and multi-select inputs
- Authentication and database integration via AWS DynamoDB and Cognito
- Simple responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Lightweight foundation for experimenting with SaaS patterns

### Global Notes

**Live Demo:** [https://global-notes-cyan.vercel.app](https://global-notes-cyan.vercel.app)

A rapid “how far can I push this in a couple of hours?” experiment using OpenAI Codex (agentic coding) to prototype an interactive 3D globe note-taking concept. The result is a lightweight, front-end-only app where you can spin/zoom the globe, click a hex-tiled region, and attach color-coded notes that persist locally in the browser.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time 3D globe rendering and smooth camera controls (drag to spin, scroll to zoom)
- Click-to-create/edit notes per globe cell with live color preview
- Persistent notes stored locally (no backend required)
- Searchable notes list with quick navigation to saved locations
- Clean, minimal UI overlays designed for both desktop and mobile layouts

**Live Demo:** [https://mars-rover-gareth-woodman.netlify.app/](https://mars-rover-gareth-woodman.netlify.app/)

Interactive solution to the classic Mars Rover coding challenge, demonstrating algorithmic thinking and clean UI implementation.
