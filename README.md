# Side Projects

This repository highlights a few of my personal projects that show my full-stack skills and self-driven approach. The code itself is private to protect intellectual property, but Iâ€™m always happy to share live demos and walk through how it all works! Most of my day-to-day commits are split across private repositories and both work and personal GitHub accounts, so my public contribution graph doesnâ€™t fully reflect my activity.

**Live Demo:** [https://www.dentie..co.uk](https://www.dentie.co.uk)

A lightweight starter SaaS application built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, DynamoDB, Cognito and Tailwind CSS. The idea was inspired by my partner, who is a dentist, and her day-to-day workflows. Building it gave me the opportunity to explore how to structure a multi-tenant app with authentication, database integration, and simple UI components. Users can create templates with single- and multi-select fields to standardize input for notes or records.

**Key Features:**
- Basic template creation with single- and multi-select inputs
- Authentication and database integration via AWS DynamoDB and Cognito
- Simple responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Lightweight foundation for experimenting with SaaS patterns
