**Introduction**

I am a motivated and outgoing individual. I made the difficult yet important decision to quit my previous job in a pursuit for a career in Development. I joined Makers in March 2020 and graduated in June. For the past several months I have polished and developed a range of personal and group projects. 

I am now on the market for a Full-Stack Developer role as Iâ€™m comfortable in both front and back-end technologies.

**Background**

After 5+ years of working in Tech Support I have a valuable understanding of how users interact with a range of software, from off-the-shelf to legacy applciations. This has been a great base to develop my technical and emotional skills. I was required to identify problems and provide solutions to a magnitude of users quickly and efficiently to keep the business going. Naturally this has led me to the development side of IT, I want to be part of the next big application!

**Objective**

I'm looking to work for an organisation where I can make a meaningful contribution, learn a lot and have a positive impact on team success. I am a fast learner, and I am willing and enthusiastic to learn new technology stacks and skills.

**Key Technologies**

Ruby-On-Rails, JavaScript (ES6), React, Node.js, Express, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Git workflow, SASS, CSS, HTML.
