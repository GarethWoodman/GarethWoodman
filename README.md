**Introduction**

I am a motivated and outgoing individual. I made the difficult yet important decision to quit my previous job in pursuit for a career in Development. I joined Makers in March 2020 and graduated in June. For the past several months I have polished and developed a range of personal and group projects. 

I am now on the market for a Full-Stack Developer role as I’m comfortable in both front and back-end technologies.

**Background**

After 5+ years of working in Tech Support I have a valuable understanding of how users interact with a range of software, from off-the-shelf to legacy applications. This has been a great base to develop my technical and emotional skills. I was required to identify problems and provide solutions to a magnitude of users quickly and efficiently to keep the business going. Naturally this has led me to the development side of IT, I want to be part of the next big application!

**Objective**

I'm looking to work for an organisation where I can make a meaningful contribution, learn a lot and have a positive impact on team success. I am a fast learner, and I am willing and enthusiastic to learn new technology stacks and skills.

**Key Technologies**

- OOP: Ruby, Swift, JavaScript(ES6)
- Frameworks: Ruby-On-Rails, Node.js, React
- Test Libraries: RSpec, Capybara, Cypress
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Misc: Git/GitHub, CSS, HTML

## Technical Skills
- Rails, Ruby, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, React - I have developed a variety of Full-Stack Applications using these technologies. I'm comfortable working in groups and independently
- Test Driven Development - One of the XP (Extreme Programming) values. We were encouraged to test drive our applications, this involved unit, feature & integration testing to ensure our applications were functioning as *expected* to avoid wasting time back-tracking and fixing petty errors.
- Behavioural Driven Development - Converting ambiguous user requirements into broken down and simplified 'User Stories' which are then translated into code.
- SOLID Principles - Adhering to these principles makes my code more clean and efficent

## Soft Skills
- Communication - As required in Tech Support I spoke with a plethora of users from virtually all departments. To fix their problems I had to establish rapport, identify the problem, and walk them through possible solutions. This transferred into my time at Makers, working in groups we were required to communicate effectively to build applications. 
- Adaptability - During my time at Makers I was encouraged to get out of my comfort zone. Pair programming with someone different every day to get a feel for how other people approach and solve problems. Regular stand-ups to present features we worked on and why we made them that way. Adapting to the current COVID situation through video conferencing.
- Time Management - I manage my time appropriately both in my professional and personal life. Having a routine is vital to success. I remain firm and fair to my commitments. I make sure to not take on more than is required. 

## What I'm currently working on:
- Swipe And Shop - A shopping application which uses the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS). The aim is to allow users to buy and sell items using an easy to use interface. 
- Night Spot - A social application using Rails. Allowing users to book and host events with people nearby
- Code Reviews - As part of Makers Alumni I practice regular code reviews to ensure I am tackling problems in the most efficient way
- Tech Tests - Through a range of resources I practice my coding skills regularly, keeping in-line with SOLID principles and up to date with the latest technologies
